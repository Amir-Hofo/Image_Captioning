# Image_Captioning
Image captioning project using the Flickr8k dataset. A custom encoder-decoder architecture was implemented based on ResNet-50 and LSTM, trained from scratch using PyTorch. The model takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption. BLEU score was used for evaluation.  

Example output:  
Target → "A BMX rider in a red and black outfit is jumping on his motorcycle."  
Model → "A person on a bike is jumping over a dirt hill."
